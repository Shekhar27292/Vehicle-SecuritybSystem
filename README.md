# Vehicle-SecuritybSystem
Implemented an IoT-based vehicle security system with a focus on user authentication and real-time monitoring. The system incorporates a face detection system using a webcam for access control. If an unauthorized person attempts access, the system captures images and alerts the owner via SMS.
